# Objective

For this workshop,  Web server is built (Apache type) in Java. The server must be able to deliver html pages and PNG images. Likewise, the server must provide an IoC framework for the construction of web applications from POJOS. Using the server, a sample web application must be built and deployed on Heroku. The server must serve multiple non-concurrent requests.
